## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r ChickWeight}
summary(ChickWeight)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
x<-ChickWeight$weight
y<-ChickWeight$Time==34
plot(x,y,xlab = "weight",ylab = "time")
```


```{r}
library("tidyverse")
 chick0<-ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Diet==4,]
 boxplot(chick0$weight~chick0$Time)
 plot(mean(chick0$weight)~mean(chick0$Time))
 legend(0.5,289,legend = c("Boxplot of ChickWeight"))
```

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
chick1<-ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Time==2,]
boxplot(chick1$weight~chick1$Time)
plot(mean(chick1$weight)~mean(chick1$Time))
legend(0.5,289,legend = c("Boxplot of Chickweight"))
```
 


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
