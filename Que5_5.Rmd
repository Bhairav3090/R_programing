## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r diamonds}
summary(diamonds)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
library(tidyverse)
plot(diamonds$price,diamonds$cut,xlab = "price",ylab = "cut")
```

## Figures

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
